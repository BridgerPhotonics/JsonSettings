# JsonSettings

Bridger Photonics fork of:
- nucs/JsonSettings 1.0.7 (branch 1.0.7-bp)

### Feature addition
#### No save on load
* When loading settings from a file that doesn't exist yet, don't save a default file. Instead use defaults in the "loaded" instance and wait to create the file until a save is requested.
